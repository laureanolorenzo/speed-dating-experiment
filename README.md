# Speed Dating Experiment
## This repository contains notebooks related to processing, analysis, and machine learning applied to the speed-dating dataset


The investigation was conducted for the final research project of the *Data Intelligence in Management* Diploma Program, taught at [*Facultad de Ciencias Econ√≥micas Uncuyo*](https://fce.uncuyo.edu.ar/). The data used for this project was gathered from a speed-dating experiment lead by researchers at Columbia University. The dataset along with its description can be found on the following URL: [Speed Dating Dataset](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&id=40536).


The original researchers published 2 papers associated with the data collected: 
[**Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence from a Speed Dating Experiment**](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/sheena.pdf), and [**Racial Preferences in Dating**](https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/866/racialPreferences.pdf).


Within the repository, you will find sections containing different tasks related to the necessary steps for the study.

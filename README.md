# Speed Dating Experiment
## This repository contains notebooks related to processing, analysis, and machine learning applied to the speed-dating dataset


This investigation was conducted for the final research project of the *Data Intelligence in Management* Diploma Program, taught at [*Facultad de Ciencias Econ√≥micas Uncuyo*](https://fce.uncuyo.edu.ar/). All of the data used for this project was gathered from a speed-dating experiment lead by researchers at Columbia University. The dataset along with its description can be found on the following Link: [Speed Dating Dataset](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&id=40536).


Originally, 2 papers associated with the collected data were published: 
[**Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence from a Speed Dating Experiment**](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/sheena.pdf), and [**Racial Preferences in Dating**](https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/866/racialPreferences.pdf). In our analysis, we take a different approach (focused more on the data mining side) and compare our results with theirs.


Within the repository, you will find sections containing different tasks related to the necessary steps for the study. 

## Sections are listed below:

* [Preprocessing](Code/Preprocessing/) 

* [Exploratory Analysis](Code/Exploratory%20Analysis/) 

* Outlier Analysis

* Hypothesis Testing 

* Machine Learning Applications

Although our research has concluded, this repository is still a work in progress and we hope to be able to update it shortly. For more information, feel free to contact the collaborators.
